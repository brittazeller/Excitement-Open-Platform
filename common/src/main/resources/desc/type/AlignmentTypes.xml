  <description>All components that implement AlignmentComponent must annotate according to the specific CAS types that are designed for alignment annotations within EOP. This file defines the two types needed for alignment within EOP. </description>

    <typeDescription>
      <name>eu.excitement.type.alignment.Target</name>
      <description>This is a CAS annotation type that can point one or more annotations (tokens, parse nodes, NER nodes, or any annotations) 
It is a list that groups annotations in one View. The target type allows flexible alignment between any data, including structures made by multiple annotations. 
Note on usage: begin holds the minimum begin value among annotations in targetAnnotations. Likewise, end should point the maximum end among annotations. </description>

          <description>This is a FSArray that can hold one or more annotations. A target should mark one or more annotations </description>

    <typeDescription>
      <name>eu.excitement.type.alignment.Link</name>
      <description>- CAS type that links two Target. 
- Multi-view type: a Link connects one target in T (TextView), the other target in H (HypothesisView). 
- Three features: "from" (alignment.Target), "to" (alignment.Target), and "strength" (double). 

The semantic of a "Link" is: The text (or structure) pointed by "from" has a relation of "type" to the text (or structure) pointed in "to". 

 We make no assumptions regarding what annotations are aligned by Link and Target types. One Target can be linked by an arbitrary number of Link, also a Target can group an arbitrary number of Annotations. Note that uima.tcas.Annotation is the super type of almost all CAS annotation data. Since a Target can group Annotation, it can group any type of annotations in CAS. </description>

          <name>from</name>
          <description>This feature points one Target. Mandatory value, and should not be null. The semantic of a "Link" is: The text (or structure) pointed by "from" has a relation of "type" to the text (or structure) pointed in "to". </description>

          <name>to</name>
          <description>This feature points one Target. Mandatory value, and should not be null. The semantic of a "Link" is: The text (or structure) pointed by "from" has a relation of "type" to the text (or structure) pointed in "to". </description>

          <name>strength</name>
          <description>This feature keeps one double (numerical) value. Mandatory value, and should not be null. The value indicates the strength of the relation. </description>
